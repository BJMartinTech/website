### Themes are Coming!

Since first designing Cartridge, I envisioned Cartridge to be a minimally designed app using mostly out-of-the-box iOS components
and a simple theme. Like many other apps out there, I've thought about what it means for Cartridge to offer themes. I thought hard about the question, "ow can we keep Cartridge minimal, yet offer a variety of themes"?

With 1.3.0, I'm excited to announce five new themes:

#### Sakura

#### Ocean

#### Lavender

#### Chrome

These four are **Cartridge Premium** themes we're offering to those who have purchased Premium as well as prospective Premium users. I think these themes will help increase the value of Premium.

That said, I'm also including another new theme for all users, free or Premium:

#### Cartridge Pink

Cartridge Pink is a mirror of the default Cartridge theme, with the main blue and pink tints swapped.

If you have any requests or ideas for themes, let us know! I'll be adding more theme variations as future versions are implemented, and I'm open to any suggestions you have.

### Enhancements to Todo Lists

Creating and editing todo lists is getting a small overhaul. Now, when you tap on a todo, you'll be able to add and/or update its title using a modal pop-up. I think this serves better UX but also opens the feature up to more additions and enhancements down the line.

### Backlog is now playing

You'll also notice that "Backlog" has been changed to "Playing". As Cartridge evolves, I'm thinking more about how to represent all of your games in a meaningful way, with some big changes coming up. This is the first step I'm taking to make what games your playing more clear to you. Look forward to future updates!
