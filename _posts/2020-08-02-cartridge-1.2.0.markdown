### Thanks for an Amazing First Month!

It's been one month since Cartridge was first announced, and almost one full month since its release!

First off, I want to thank everyone who downloaded Cartridge. In just the first month since landing on the App Store, Cartridge has seen just under 1 million impressions, and just under 1000 downloads. Cartridge gets better with every request and suggestion
users give us, so we couldn't have gotten this far without you.

### Cartridge Premium

I want to give a special thanks to everybody who purchased Cartridge Premium. Premium helps support development costs and helps give me the opportunity to make Cartridge a full-time job. For the first month since launch, Cartridge Premium costed approximately $5 USD (depending on your local currency, that could be a bit more or less). As I continue to add features to Cartridge Premium, and as I continue to measure how to keep Cartridge self-sustaining, I'm announcing that Cartridge Premium now costs $10 USD (again, depending on your local currency, that could be more or less).

I believe that with the upcoming additions to Cartridge Premium, and with the generous Free tier (10 games limit, and full access to Notes, Reviews, Favorites, Paused, and more), that $10 USD is a fair price going forward. That said, in an effort to make Premium more "worth it", larger upcoming features are generally skewed towards Premium-only users. The first example of this is **Todo Lists**, a new feature you'll read more about below.

Free (ie. available to all) features will still be added onto Cartridge as you'll see below, and I plan to continue to provide updates that'll improve the experience for both Free and Premium users.

### Version 1.2.0

#### Todo Lists!

The first of many Premium-only features is **Todo Lists**.

Starting with version 1.2.0, you can add todo items to each game you're playing via a Todo List. Adding todos lets you track things like side quests, tasks, daily missions, or even main story quests as you're playing the game.

This is something I've always wanted to track while playing games, especially as many games today have missable quests or storylines that can be easily forgotten about. I've also heard of users wanting to use this for Animal Crossing, by tracking their daily and even long-term goals while playing.

Whatever you decide to use it for, I hope you find it useful. Feel free to share how you use, or plan to use, Todo Lists on Cartridge by tagging us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Cartridge_App)!

#### Updates to the Game Page

Version 1.2.0 also includes a hefty update to the visual design of the Game page. Attributes like game genres, platforms, and backlog priorities are now better formatted as a horizontal list. I've also surfaced other information like "Date Added", "Date Completed", and "Date Paused".

I've also added a new field, "Date Started", which I hope helps those who wants to track exactly when they start playing a game. In conjunction with Date Completed, you can now get a better idea of how long you've been playing a game.

#### Other Updates in 1.2.0

Version 1.2.0 contains many other small updates, such as bug fixes, enhancements, and new Home Screen icon shortcuts! Here's a quick list of other small things that were added and/or fixed:

- Added a Home Screen Icon shortcut for adding new games
- Fixed some bugs when importing games from IGDB
- Added some new platforms
- I've seen some mysterious crashes happen to some devices, and I've added some code to try and fix it. If you're experiencing crashes in Cartridge, please reach out to me and let me know so I can fix them for a future update.

Once again, thank you for using Cartridge. Stay updated by following us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Cartridge_App), or bookmarking our [Blog](https://pixelatedcontroller.com/blog). If you have any requests or suggestions, feel free to tweet at me, or email me (both are accessible directly in Cartridge settings as well).

Happy Gaming!
