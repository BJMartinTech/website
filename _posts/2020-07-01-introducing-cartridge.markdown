## Manage your video game backlog and get ready to game even more than ever

I'm excited to announce Cartridge, Pixelated Controller's first app: a video game backlog
manager that aims to help you prioritize games you're currently playing.

Like many gamers, we experienced a small "problem" with taking on way too many games at the same time. With
so many good games being released, it's easy to become overwhelmed with finishing them,
especially as their play time begins to extend beyond 10, 20, or even 60 hours.

As you purchase day-one releases of the latest and greatest games, decide to replay older entires, and scoop up deals during Steam Summer Sales, it's easy to find yourself a dozen-deep into a gaming backlog. And if you play games on multiple consoles,
you'll likely find yourself doubling the amount of games you need to get through.

As a consequence - something I've personally experienced - games are usually left unfinished in favour of others, and  once
games enter the realm of "I'll play it later", the chances of it being finished narrow closer to zero.

### Track your backlog

Cartridge aims to help with this, by tracking your backlog and letting you organize by completion date (if you like working towards a goal) and priority (to help you keep focus on what's next).

As I tested the app, I realized that simply being able to look at a list of games I'm currently playing went a long way
to recognizing what I need to focus on, and helped me finish games quicker than before. As you use Cartridge and enter your
games, you're able to track them by increasing a progression bar as you play. It almost feels like a game within a game -- I often found myself playing enough to justify increasing my progress from 40% to 50%, just to get "halfway done"!

### Pause, Favorite, and Mark Games Complete

Of course, "progress" and "game completion" can mean different things to everyone. To some, 100% completion truly means 100% - platinum trophy, all secrets discovered, and achieving maximum level on every character. To others, 100% can mean finishing the main story. There's no right or wrong way to track your games, and Cartridge is flexible to let you track as much as you prefer.

As you play through and complete games, they get moved to a "Completed" list in Cartridge, where you can glance at how many games you've managed to finish.

You might also find the need to pause games and remove them from your backlog, and Cartridge offers the ability to do so. Now, instead of pausing games and forgetting about them, a Paused list allows you to regularly review what you have left to pick back up.

Skirting the edge of backlog management, Cartridge also lets you favorite games into a Favorites list. As trivial as it might seem, we hope that favoriting allows you to sufficiently mark whether or not you've enjoyed playing that particular game.

### Take Notes, and Write Reviews

To help beyond simply managing your gaming progress, Cartridge offers the ability to take notes for each game you play. With Notes, you can jot down ideas on the tough puzzle you're trying to solve, elemental weaknesses of the next boss, or even write down some quick thoughts and impressions of the plot.

If you enjoy reviewing games, each game has a Review section as well, giving you the ability to write down what you think of the game. The best part is, you can do this as you play, or as a retrospective after you've completed the game.

### Launching July-August 2020

Cartridge is in the final phases of development. I'm currently polishing a few things up, fixing up bugs, and testing as much as I can. My aim is to launch Cartridge as early as late-July 2020, and as late as mid-August 2020. I know it's vague, but I'll be
sure to update you as the date nears.

Cartridge will be a free app limited to tracking 10 games, with a _one-time purchase to track without limits_. We have no plans to sell a subscription for Cartridge, and hope that by making the base app free, we allow as many people to use it as possible.

As this is Pixelated Controller's first app, thank you for being here and giving us a chance. Stay updated by following us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Cartridge_App), or bookmarking our [Blog](https://pixelatedcontroller.com/blog). We're excited to
