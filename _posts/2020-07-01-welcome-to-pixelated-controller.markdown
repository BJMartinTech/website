Today, I'm excited to formally launch Pixelated Controller to the world of gaming and technology.

I should start with introductions. My name is Jeff Martin, and Pixelated Controller is a pseudonym for me
to create apps, websites, blogs, guides - you name it - on one of the things of I love most: video games.

As of today, the collective gaming world is beyond excited for the upcoming launch of the next generation of consoles.
The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X are poised to change the landscape, and us gamers are eager to welcome their arrival.
New console generations don't happen often. It's only once every 7-10 years that we can get excited for huge leaps in the graphics, immersion, storytelling, gameplay that new consoles promise, and this time around, that excitement peaks higher than ever.

Personally, I've played thousands of hours on the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 combined, and I can't count how many times I've played a game and thought to myself: "this is it, this is the peak of gaming". Each Uncharted game I played, I was convinced we had reached the pinnacle of video game graphics, animation, and immersion. Then its sequel would be released. Eventually, games like Spider-Man and Horizon Zero Dawn came around delivering greater accomplishments. In retrospect, and suddenly, it feels like we're at a level (pun intended) where unprecedented breakthroughs are once again making their way from the horizon (also pun intended) to our very experiences in gaming.

And just when we're still expecting games like Ghost of Tsushima and Cyberpunk 2077 - two of what some might also call peaks in
gaming - we remember that there's a whole slew of games about to blow our minds coming for the next generation consoles. And it's not just about better graphics and more immersive experiences. It's also about an evolution of brand new genres that boast fresh gameplay mechanics like Virtual Reality.

And while we impatiently wait for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, let's not forget the currently dominating Nintendo Switch, which continuously challenges gamers on the notion of graphics versus gameplay, and delivering some of the most fun experiences Nintendo is best at.

Video games give us a sense of joy and accomplishment like no other medium, and Pixelated Controller is about augmenting that experience to make our gaming lives easier.

My goal with Pixelated Controller is simply: "to provide tools, resources, and all kinds of power-ups to empower your gaming experience. Even when you're not gaming".

It's broad, I know, but that lets me engage on different types of work to achieve that goal. From mobile app, websites, blogs, reviews, and even sharing video game collections, there's a lot I'm excited to tackle.

Our first product is an iOS app I'm expecting to announce and release very soon, and I'm both nervous and excited to see what you think about it. If you're an avid gamer, and are always looking for new things to help spice your gaming up, feel free to bookmark this blog, which I plan to keep updated with all kinds of announcements.
