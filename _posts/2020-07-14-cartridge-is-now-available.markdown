I'm excited to announce that Cartridge is now available for everyone to download, on iPhone and iPad!

Over the weekend, Cartridge launched worldwide on the App Store. In the first three days, more than 300 people have downloaded the app and have started tracking, and making, progress towards completing their gaming backlogs. Thank you to everybody who supported and downloaded the app, and to everybody who purchased Cartridge Premium.

If you're a gamer who wants to track your backlog, read more about Cartridge in our [introductory post explaining the idea and features behind the app]().


### More Features are Coming Soon

Since releasing the game over the weekend, we've received plenty of suggestions, feature requests, and ideas, that's already being worked on. Version 1.1.0 is coming soon, and introduces enhancements to adding games to Cartridge by searching and importing from IGDB. The new update will also include several small quality of life features, such as added platforms, genres, and sort options, and more! Best of all, all of these new enhancements will be free.

In the version following 1.1.0, we plan to start looking at adding more Premium-only features. As we continue to improve Cartridge and the experience of manaing your backlog, we plan to deliver several free and Premium-only features to help those who want to stay as a Free user, as well as provide more functionality to those who upgrade. Stay tuned for more announcements on our roadmap, and feature plans.
