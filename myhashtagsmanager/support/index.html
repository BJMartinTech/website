    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <br />

    <h2>How do I delete my hashtag sets?</h2>
    <p>
      You can delete hashtag sets by swiping left on each card in the home screen, or tapping on the delete button.
    </p>

    <br />

    <h2>How do I remove ads?</h2>
    <p>
      My Hashtags Manager is a free app supported by ads. If you'd like to remove ads, you can choose to do so by tapping the Settings icon on the top left corner, and finding the "Remove Ads" option.
      Removing ads is a Premium purchase, but helps support development and provides a better experience for you as you continue to use the app.
    </p>

    <br />

    <h2>I already purchased the removal of ads, but it still shows them to me. What do I do?</h2>
    <p>
      If you've already purchased the "Remove Ads" feature, try tapping "Restore In-App Purchases" in the app's settings. You'll be asked to log in to the Apple account you used to purchase the Remove Ads feature.
      Once you're verified, and we have received confirmation from Apple that you have purchased the feature, you should now see no ads in the app.
      <br />
      <br />
      If you continue to see ads, it's possible that the account you're using does not have the feature purchased. If that is the case, please try purchasing the feature.
      If that is not the case, please let us know by emailing us <a href="mailto:bjmartin.technology@gmail.com">here</a>.
