    <h1>BJ Martin Apps - General Privacy Policy</h1>
  </div>

  <div id="post-content">
    <p>
      <b>We believe in keeping your data private and available to you at all times</b>. We value your privacy and make conscious efforts at how your data is stored.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cartridge, My Check In Time, My Hashtags Manager ("apps"), are owned, developed, and maintained by Bryan Martin ("we", or "us"). This Privacy Policy is designed to tell you about our practices regarding the
      use, collection, and disclosure of information that we or its third party service providers use through the Cartridge application.

    <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      We do not have any servers and do not use any in-house analytics tools to track or
      analyze your usage of any of our apps. We cannot read, view, or analyze any data you have stored in our apps, either locally or remotely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of our apps use Google Mobile Ads to serve and display ads on some screens. Some data may be collected by the app and sent to Google as part of Google's SDK. Data managed by Google is subject to Google's Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of our apps use iCloud. This can be turned off via iOS' iCloud Settings. We cannot, and do not, collect, or view, any data you may have stored in iCloud. Data stored in iCloud is subject to Apple's Privacy Policy.
    </p>
      
    <h2>Third Party Services We Use</h2>
    <h3>Google Mobile Ads</h3>
    <p>
      Google Mobile Ads is a framework offered by Google to serve and display ads to mobile apps. In the apps that support Google Mobile Ads, we use Google's SDK directly to ask for ads to show.
    </p>

    <br />

    <h3>iCloud</h3>
    <p>
      iCloud is a cloud storage service provided by Apple, Inc. In some of our apps, we use the built-in iCloud capability of your iOS device to keep your apps' data synced across your devices. In the apps that support iCloud, by  default,
      data in our apps are synced to iCloud across your devices. This can be turned off via iOS Settings, under iCloud. We cannot access, and do not have access to, the data you have stored in iCloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the event that you would like all of your apps' data removed from iCloud, we allow you to export or delete all of your data in our apps via its settings, under <em>Meta</em>.
      You can view Apple's Privacy Policy at <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/legal/privacy/en-ww/">https://www.apple.com/ca/legal/privacy/en-ww/</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>IGDB</h3>
    <p>
      Cartridge includes an optional feature to search and import video game cover images from a third-party service called IGDB. IGDB is a third-party API service that serves a collection of
      video game cover art to users. By using the "Search via IGDB" feature in Cartridge, you are using the IGDB service.
      The app sends only the search query that is typed in the search bar to the IGDB API. No other Cartridge data
      is sent to the IGDB API other than what is filled out on the IGDB Search field. IGDB is owned by Twitch, Inc., and you can view their Privacy Policy at
      <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/privacy-notice/">https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/privacy-notice/</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Cartridge: Exporting or Deleting your Data</h2>
    <p>
      If you would like to remove all of your data from Cartridge, we allow you to export or delete data you have stored in Cartridge via the app's settings under <em>App</em>.
    </p>
