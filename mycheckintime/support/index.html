    <br />

    <h2>What types of work check-ins does the app support?</h2>
    <p>
      If your workplace supports "time-ins" or "check-ins" by scanning a QR code to sign in, then you can use this app to directly scan the code, open the website, and sign in.
      <br />
      Once finished, press "Done", and the app will log your check-in by date and time.
