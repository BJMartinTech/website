    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <br />

    <h2>I can't create more than 10 games.</h2>
    <p>
      Cartridge only allows tracking up to 10 games if you have not purchased Cartridge Premium.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you'd like to track your entire video game backlog, please consider purchasing Cartridge Premium to help support us.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to remain as a Cartridge Free user, and want to track new games, you can still delete older games to add newer ones, as long as you're under the 10 game limit.
    </p>

    <h2>I want to use the camera to take a photo of my games, but it's not letting me.</h2>
    <p>
      Cartridge requires iOS permission in order to be able to access the camera. You should have been asked for permission the first time you tapped "Take Photo"
      when editing your Game Cover Image. If you're currently not able to access the camera, it's likely you denied permission a while back. To re-enable Camera access,
      <b>go to the built-in iOS Settings app, then tap <u>Privacy</u>, <u>Camera</u>, and toggle on Cartridge.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have given Cartridge permission, but are still not able to access the camera within the app, please contact us via <a href="mailto:pixelatedcontroller.apps@gmail.com">email</a> and we'll take a look!
    </p>

    <h2>I can't find the game or game cover image I'm searching for in Cartridge.</h2>
    <p>
      We use a third-party service called IGDB to search for video games. For best results, try to search for the exact names or use keywords of the game you're looking for.
      For example, if you're looking for "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild", try searching <u>"Breath of the Wild"</u> or <u>"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild"</u>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're not getting any results back, it's possible that the game can't be found on IGDB. If so, you can still enter your game manually by tapping on the <b>Skip</b> button on the top-right of the search page.
      We apologize for any inconvenience.
    </p>

    <h2>I'm trying to purchase Cartridge Premium, but I'm not able to.</h2>
    <p>
      Make sure that you're logged into an Apple account on your iPhone or iPad, and that you have In-App Purchases enabled.
    </p>
    <p>
      To check if you have In-App Purchases enabled, go to the <b>iOS Settings app, Screen Time, Content & Privacy Restrictions</b>. Make sure that <b>iTunes &amp; App Store Purchases</b> are allowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are still not able to purchase Cartridge Premium after ensuring the above, please contact us via <a href="mailto:pixelatedcontroller.apps@gmail.com">email</a> and we'll take a look!
    </p>

    <h2>I purchased Cartridge Premium, but I still can't add more than 10 games or access Premium features.</h2>
    <p>
      First, make sure that you're logged into an Apple account on your iPhone or iPad you have purchased Premium with.
      Next, make sure that Cartridge knows you've purchased Premium. You can check this by going to Cartridge Settings -> Cartridge Premium.
      <br />

      <ul>
        <li>If it says "Premium Purchased. Thank you!", then Cartridge knows you have purchased Premium.</li>
        <li>If it says "Purchase", that means you likely have to restore your purchases.</li>
      </ul>

      <br />
      If you've deleted and reinstalled the app recently, you'll need to go to Cartridge Settings -> Cartridge Premium and tap "Restore Purchase".
      After a few seconds, you should see a message telling you your purchase has been restored.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once your purchase has been verified and/or restored, try adding more than 10 games or accessing a Premium feature again.
      If it still doesn't work, try again by closing and removing the app from your recent apps list, and reopening it.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are still not able to access Premium content after all of the above, please contact us via <a href="mailto:pixelatedcontroller.apps@gmail.com">email</a> and we'll take a look.
      Please provide us with the following:
      <br />
      <ol>
        <li>A screenshot of the Cartride Premium settings page.</li>
        <li>A screenshot of the feature you can't access. Typically, if you can't access it, you will see a message saying the feature is Premium only, please show that as well.</li>
        <li>Your iOS device and model, and the version of iOS you're running.</li>
      </ol>
      <br />
      We apologize for the inconvenience this causes and we'll try to fix it asap!
    </p>
