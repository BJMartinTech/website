    <p>
      <b>We believe in keeping your data private and available to you at all times</b>. We at Pixelated Controller value your privacy and make conscious efforts at how your data is stored.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cartridge is owned, developed, and maintained by Jeff Martin ("Pixelated Controller", "we", or "us"). This Privacy Policy is designed to tell you about our practices regarding the
      use, collection, and disclosure of information that we or its third party service providers use through the Cartridge application.

    <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      Pixelated Controller does not collect, track, or store any of your data on our servers. We do not have any servers. We do not use any third party analytics tools to track or
      analyze your usage of Cartridge. We cannot read, view, or analyze any data you have stored in Cartridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only instance when your data leaves your device is when the app is synced to iCloud. This can be turned off via iOS' iCloud Settings. We cannot, and do not, collect, or view, any data
      you may have stored in iCloud.  
    </p>
      
    <h2>Third Party Services We Use</h2>
    <h3>iCloud</h3>
    <p>
      iCloud is a cloud storage service provided by Apple, Inc. We use the built-in iCloud capability of your iOS device to keep Cartridge synced across your devices. By default,
      data in Cartridge is synced to iCloud across your devices. This can be turned off via iOS Settings, under iCloud. We cannot, and do not, have access to the data you have stored in iCloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the event that you would like all of your Cartridge data removed from iCloud, we allow you to export or delete all of your data in Cartridge via settings, under <em>Meta</em>.
      You can view Apple's Privacy Policy at <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/legal/privacy/en-ww/">https://www.apple.com/ca/legal/privacy/en-ww/</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>IGDB</h3>
    <p>
      Cartridge includes an optional feature to search and import video game cover images from a third-party service called IGDB. IGDB is a third-party API service that serves a collection of
      video game cover art to users. By using the "Search via IGDB" feature in Cartridge, you are using the IGDB service.
      The app sends only the search query that is typed in the search bar to the IGDB API. No other Cartridge data
      is sent to the IGDB API other than what is filled out on the IGDB Search field. IGDB is owned by Twitch, Inc., and you can view their Privacy Policy at
      <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/privacy-notice/">https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/privacy-notice/</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Exporting or Deleting your Data</h2>

      If you would like to remove all of your data from Cartridge, we allow you to export or delete data you have stored in Cartridge via the app's settings under <em>Meta</em>.
